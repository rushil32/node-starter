# MEAN starter template

After starting from scratch over and over again while learning MEAN web development I decided to finally put a good starter template together. The app uses Node, Express, Angular 2 and Boostrap 4. 

I've also included a basic CRUD module that works end to end for referrence. 

## Node server

Run `ng build` for server side development. The app will automatically do a build of the client side app and run the server in watch mode. Navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Angular 2 app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Sample CRUD Module

A sample CRUD module has been included for referrence in the form of a feedback form. The form can be used to retrieve a list from a Mongo Database, save data, edit data and delete data.
